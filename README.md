## How to Run the Code
This project is optimized for running in Google Colab with GPU acceleration. It is recommended that you run the code in the cloud e.g Google Colab Pro+ (SMOTE-Tomek) and Pro Pro (other class balancing techniques)
	
    1.	Mount your Google Drive 
        from google.colab import drive
        drive.mount('/content/drive')
        
    2.  Set paths for dataset files (update notebook):
        • ISIC 2017 dataset:
			- Training ZIP: /content/...ISIC-2017_Training_Data.zip (replace with the location to your training files on the drive)
			- Testing ZIP: /content/...ISIC-2017_Test_v2_Data.zip (replace with the location to your testing files on the drive)
			- Validation ZIP: /content/...ISIC-2017_Validation_Data.zip (replace with the location to your validation files on the drive)
			- Training CSV: /content/...ISIC-2017_Training_Part3_GroundTruth.csv (replace with the location to your training ground truth file on the drive)
			- Testing CSV: /content/...ISIC-2017_Test_v2_Part3_GroundTruth.csv (replace with the location to your testing ground truth file on the drive)
			- Validation CSV: /content/...ISIC-2017_Validation_Part3_GroundTruth.csv (replace with the location to your validation ground truth file on the drive)
		• ISIC 2018 dataset:
			- Training ZIP: /content/...ISIC2018_Task3_Training_Input.zip (replace with the location to your training files on the drive)
			- Testing ZIP: /content/...ISIC2018_Task3_Test_Input.zip (replace with the location to your testing files on the drive)
			- Validation ZIP: /content/...ISIC2018_Task3_Validation_Input.zip (replace with the location to your validation files on the drive)
			- Training CSV: /content/...ISIC2018_Task3_Training_GroundTruth.csv (replace with the location to your training ground truth file on the drive)
			- Testing CSV: /content/...ISIC2018_Task3_Test_GroundTruth.csv (replace with the location to your testing ground truth file on the drive)
			- Validation CSV: /content/...ISIC2018_Task3_Validation_GroundTruth.csv (replace with the location to your validation ground truth file on the drive)
		• Other Directories for Storage:
			- Deep Learning Models and Results - "/content/drive/MyDrive/Deep Learning/Results" (replace with the location for storing models and results)
			- MODEL_PATH = "/content/drive/MyDrive/Deep Learning/Results/skin_cancer_resnet50_model_best_v9.1-5.h5" (replace with the location of the model of your choice)
			- Grad-CAM results - RESULTS_DIR = /content/drive/MyDrive/Deep Learning/Results/Results_Grad_Cam (replace with the location you intend to store the Grad-CAM results)

    3. To experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g. experiment G1.1):
        • run_experiment(BATCH_SIZE=8, LOSS = 'categorical_crossentropy', LR=1e-4, NUM_classes = 3)
			- replace the BATCH_SIZE, LOSS, LR, NUM_classes with your specific experimental settings
		• NOTE:
			- BATCH_SIZE corresponds to batch size
			- LOSS corresponds to loss function
			- LR corresponds to learning rate
			- NUM_classes corresponds to number of classes in the dataset

    4. Run the code
